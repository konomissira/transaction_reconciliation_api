# Transaction Reconciliation API

A production-ready REST API for reconciling transactions between different systems using Python set operations.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates efficient transaction reconciliation techniques for matching records between two systems (finance vs payment processor, source vs target database, etc.) using set intersection and difference operations.

## Features

-   Compare transactions from two different systems
-   Find matched records using SET INTERSECTION
-   Identify discrepancies using SET DIFFERENCE
-   Generate reconciliation reports
-   Calculate match rates and discrepancies
-   REST API for automated reconciliation
-   PostgreSQL database for transaction tracking
-   Docker containerization for easy deployment
-   Comprehensive API documentation
